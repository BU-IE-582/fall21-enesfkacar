# Welcome to Enes Kacar's GitHub Pages

This is my [Progress Journal website](https://bu-ie-582.github.io/fall21-enesfkacar/) created for IE 582 course at Bogazici University. You can also visit my personal Github [Website](https://enesfkacar.github.io/). 

## Homework Assignments

There will be several homework assignments done for this course.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BU-IE-582/fall21-baydoganmustafa/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
